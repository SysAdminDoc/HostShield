## Quick Start

1. If v6.9.16 or earlier is installed, export a HostShield backup if needed and
   uninstall it. v6.9.61 and later use a new APK certificate lineage, so Android cannot
   perform an in-place update over the older certificate. Uninstalling clears
   the previous app data.
2. Download the newest `HostShield-v*-full-release.apk` asset from
   [Releases](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/HostShield/releases).
3. Install and launch: the onboarding wizard guides you through setup.
4. Choose **VPN mode** (no root) or **Root mode** (better battery life), then
   enable blocking.

### Obtainium (auto-update from GitHub)

Add HostShield in [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) with:

- **App Source URL**: `https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/HostShield`
- **Release asset filter**: `full-release.apk`
- **Version detection**: from GitHub release tag

```

**VPN Mode** (no root): Creates a local-only VPN tunnel. All DNS queries pass through HostShield's packet engine. No traffic leaves the device to any remote server.

**Root Mode**: Redirects DNS via iptables NAT rules to a local proxy on `127.0.0.1:5454`. Zero battery overhead. Per-app firewall via iptables.

---

## Background & Support

**The idea.** Good network-level ad, tracker, and malware blocking on Android has
always meant choosing one tool and giving something up: AdAway needs root, DNS66
is unmaintained, NetGuard is firewall-first, and RethinkDNS is VPN-only. HostShield
started as an attempt to stop choosing: to put the strongest ideas from each of
those projects behind one dual-mode engine (no-root VPN *and* rooted iptables),
with encrypted DNS, a per-app firewall, and honest, local-only diagnostics in the
same app.

**The principles it's built on.** These are non-negotiable and shape every release:

- **Local-first.** All DNS filtering happens on-device. There is no account, no
  hosted resolver, and no analytics or crash-reporting SDK. The only outbound
  requests are the ones you can see in the FAQ below (blocklist downloads,
  encrypted DNS to your chosen provider, optional GeoIP, optional signed list
  updates).
- **Fail closed.** Encrypted DNS and other security-sensitive paths refuse to
  silently fall back to plaintext when something goes wrong.
- **Auditable.** GPL-3.0, open source, reproducible-leaning release provenance,
  and no closed-source resolver or filter engine in the default build.

**Who builds it.** HostShield is developed and maintained by
[@SysAdminDoc](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc), an independent developer with a
systems-administration background, not a company or a funded team. That means
releases ship when they're ready and there is no roadmap driven by monetization :
but it also means the project lives or dies on the maintainer's own continued use.

**Will it be abandonware in six months?** The honest answer: it's an independent
project, so no guarantee can be absolute. What can be said is concrete: the app
is actively developed (see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and the release
cadence above), it's the maintainer's daily driver, and every release is
open-source under GPL-3.0. If development ever stops, the code, build scripts, and
signing story are all in this repository, so anyone can fork and keep it alive.
Bug reports and feature requests are read and acted on: [open an issue](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/HostShield/issues).

## Features

### DNS Blocking Engine

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bloom + Trie + Hash Set Lookup** | Snapshot-local Bloom pre-check fast-rejects cold negative domains, O(1) hash set handles exact matches, and O(m) reversed-label trie handles wildcard policy. 200K+ domains. |
| **Filter Decision Cache** | LRU cache (8K entries) for `isBlocked()` results: skips trie entirely for hot domains |
| **CNAME Cloaking Detection** | Inspects full CNAME chains + SVCB/HTTPS records (TYPE 64/65). Checks against main blocklist + dedicated AdGuard/NextDNS CNAME cloak databases |
| **DNS Response Cache** | 2000-entry LRU with serve-stale (RFC 8767), negative caching (RFC 2308), SERVFAIL caching (RFC 9520), Unbound-style prefetching, and in-flight query coalescing |
| **Serve-Stale (RFC 8767)** | Returns expired cache entries during WiFi/cellular transitions. 3-day stale window, 30s stale TTL. Background refresh on stale serve |
| **Cache Prefetching** | When TTL < 10% remaining and domain queried 3+ times, serves from cache and refreshes in background. Near-zero latency for popular domains |
| **Configurable TTL** | 60s minimum floor, 24h maximum ceiling. SOA-derived TTL for NXDOMAIN negative caching |
| **Block Response Types** | NXDOMAIN (with SOA), Null IP (0.0.0.0/::), or REFUSED: configurable per preference |
| **Regex & Wildcard Rules** | Block/allow domains by regex pattern (capped at 500 chars, ReDoS-safe) or wildcard (`*.example.com`) |
| **DoH Bypass Prevention** | Blocks 65+ known DoH provider domains + wildcard patterns, with dual-stack DNS/DoH trap routes. Remote domain/IP updates are signature-verified before local policy changes |

### Encrypted DNS

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)** | RFC 8484 POST+GET. Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, NextDNS, AdGuard, Mullvad, CleanBrowsing |
| **DNS-over-TLS (DoT)** | RFC 7858, TLSv1.3, SNI + hostname verification. Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, AdGuard |
| **DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)** | Debug-only experimental simplified engine, not a full QUIC/TLS 1.3 stack. Release builds hide the control and force DoQ off; pinned DoH/DoT remain the production encrypted-DNS path |
| **DNS-over-WireGuard** | Debug-only experimental DNS-only engine, not a full WireGuard tunnel. Release builds hide the control and force WireGuard DNS off; pinned DoH/DoT remain the production encrypted-DNS path |
| **Certificate Pinning** | Fail-closed SHA-256 pin validation per provider from a versioned local manifest with primary/backup pins and review/expiry diagnostics |
| **Certificate Transparency** | Global CT enforcement for encrypted-DNS TLS on Android 16/API 36 and Android 17/API 37, including custom resolver hosts |
| **Smart Latency Failover** | EMA-based latency tracking per provider, auto-selects fastest, falls back through all on failure |
| **DNS Trap** | Routes hardcoded DNS IPs (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, etc.) through VPN tunnel to prevent bypass |
| **LAN DNS Server** | Default-off Settings gate runs UDP DNS serving on an unprivileged port (5353 by default) as a foreground service; private LAN clients are allowed by default and public-source clients require an explicit toggle |
| **TCP DNS** | Full TCP DNS support for responses >512 bytes, IPv4 + IPv6 |

```

**Signing**: Production-signed release artifacts require `KEYSTORE_FILE`,
`STORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, and `KEY_PASSWORD`. Current releases use the
HostShield certificate with SHA-256 fingerprint
`811A9302984EC073B44B84B55DB959CA7D32C5CA75A4318C675BA7B065E3278B`,
matching v6.9.65. The private key stays outside Git and is never attached to a release.

**Release flow**: Builds, tests, release-doc checks, protection-resilience matrix capture, provenance generation, and GitHub Release uploads run locally on this workstation. The repository intentionally ships without GitHub Actions workflows.

---

## Configuration

### Blocklist Sources

Ships with curated defaults. AdAway Default and StevenBlack Unified are enabled out of the box; OISD, HaGeZi, 1Hosts, and other sources remain available from the gallery for stricter filtering. Spotify Ads uses HostShield's maintained 84-host list and is included as an optional built-in, but stays disabled until explicitly enabled because it includes playback and update hosts. Add custom URL sources via Settings > Sources in hosts, domains-only, or DNS adblock syntax.

**Source categories**: ADS, TRACKERS, MALWARE, ADULT, SOCIAL, CRYPTO, ALLOWLIST, CUSTOM. Allowlist sources override block entries during updates, including adblock `@@||` exception lists.

### Upstream DNS

Default: system DNS. Configure custom upstream DNS servers (comma-separated) in Settings. DoH providers: Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, NextDNS, AdGuard, Mullvad, CleanBrowsing.

### LAN DNS Server

Settings includes an explicit default-off LAN DNS server gate for advanced local-network setups. When enabled, HostShield starts a foreground service that serves UDP DNS on port 5353 by default, rejects public-source clients unless explicitly allowed, and requests Android 17 `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK` before serving a non-53 port. The current build targets SDK 37.

The Android 17 socket audit covers these paths:

| Path | Network boundary | API 37 treatment |
|---|---|---|
| `LocalDnsServerService` → `LocalDnsServer` | Wildcard UDP listener on the configured unprivileged port (1024 to 65535; 5353 by default) | Runtime `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK` is required for target SDK 37+; the service and boot restore fail closed if it is not granted |
| `DnsProxyService` | Loopback-only UDP listener on `127.0.0.1:5353` | Not LAN access |
| `RootDnsLogger` | Loopback-only UDP listeners on `127.0.0.1` and `::1` | Not LAN access |
| `DnsForwarder`, `DnsProxyService`, `RootDnsLogger`, `DnsVpnService`, `DnsBenchmark`, and `LocalDnsServer` upstream forwarding | DNS traffic to port 53 | Covered by Android's local-network DNS port-53 exemption |
| DoH/DoT/DoQ, leak tests, and update/download clients | Fixed public or user-approved Internet endpoints | Not LAN access; DoQ and WireGuard remain debug-only |
| `WireGuardProxy` | Debug-only configurable peer endpoint, potentially private and non-53 | Release builds force this path off; a future target-SDK-37 debug-network pass must request permission before using a private-LAN endpoint |

Port 53 is intentionally not an available local listener because Android apps cannot bind privileged ports without elevated privileges; the exemption applies to DNS traffic addressed to port 53. See [Android's local network permission guidance](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/local-network-permission) for the platform rules.

### Block Response Type

Choose how blocked domains are handled:
- **NXDOMAIN** (default): domain doesn't exist, includes SOA for negative caching
- **Null IP**: returns 0.0.0.0 (A) or :: (AAAA), connection fails immediately
- **REFUSED**: DNS server refuses the query

### Automation API

Broadcast intents for Tasker/MacroDroid, shell, and same-signature companion apps. Canonical actions use `com.hostshield.ACTION_*`; older lowercase `com.hostshield.action.*` aliases are accepted for compatibility.

```bash
# Enable/disable protection
adb shell am broadcast -a com.hostshield.ACTION_ENABLE  -n com.hostshield/.service.AutomationReceiver
adb shell am broadcast -a com.hostshield.ACTION_DISABLE -n com.hostshield/.service.AutomationReceiver

# Query current status
adb shell am broadcast -a com.hostshield.ACTION_STATUS  -n com.hostshield/.service.AutomationReceiver

# Force blocklist refresh
adb shell am broadcast -a com.hostshield.ACTION_REFRESH_BLOCKLIST -n com.hostshield/.service.AutomationReceiver

# Apply profile or custom DNS
adb shell am broadcast -a com.hostshield.ACTION_SET_PROFILE --es profile_name Work -n com.hostshield/.service.AutomationReceiver
adb shell am broadcast -a com.hostshield.ACTION_SET_DNS --es dns_servers "9.9.9.9,149.112.112.112" -n com.hostshield/.service.AutomationReceiver

# Pause/resume (5 minutes)
adb shell am broadcast -a com.hostshield.ACTION_PAUSE --ei duration_minutes 5 -n com.hostshield/.service.AutomationReceiver
adb shell am broadcast -a com.hostshield.ACTION_PAUSE --ei duration_minutes 0 -n com.hostshield/.service.AutomationReceiver
```

Public actions are protected by HostShield's signature-level automation permission, rate-limited (5s cooldown per action per caller), and logged to the automation audit log.

## FAQ

**VPN mode vs Root mode?**
Root mode: zero battery overhead, requires rooted device with Magisk, KernelSU, or APatch. VPN mode: works on any device, ~1-3% battery, persistent notification. Both use the same blocking engine.

**Which root frameworks are supported?**
Magisk, KernelSU, and APatch are supported when HostShield has root permission. Magisk 26+ firewall commands use libsu's mount-master shell. KernelSU and APatch use the default `su` shell; hosts-file editing needs an active systemless hosts module such as bindhosts because those frameworks do not ship built-in systemless hosts. HostShield detects Magisk `hosts`, bindhosts, and the KernelSU systemless-hosts module paths under `/data/adb/modules/` when present. Without one, root DNS and firewall rules can still work through iptables, but direct hosts-file edits may fail on read-only `/system`.

**Why does it use a VPN?**
Entirely local: no traffic goes to a remote server. The VPN tunnel intercepts DNS queries on the device and filters them locally. Standard technique used by NetGuard, RethinkDNS, Blokada, and DNS66.

**How is this different from AdAway?**
CNAME cloaking detection (including SVCB/HTTPS records), serve-stale DNS cache (RFC 8767), fail-closed DoH with certificate pinning and selected-provider preference, per-app iptables firewall, live query streaming, 7-day trend charts, query anomaly detection, rate-limited GeoIP lookup, tracker SDK scanning, DNS leak test, automation API, and a modern Material 3 Compose UI.

**How is this different from RethinkDNS?**
HostShield focuses on local DNS blocking with a curated gallery of 45+ blocklists. It has a dual-mode architecture (VPN + root) while RethinkDNS is VPN-only. HostShield includes an iptables-based per-app firewall for rooted devices, tracker SDK scanning, and hosts file diffing.

**Does it work with other VPNs?**
In VPN mode: no: Android only allows one VPN at a time. In root mode: yes: iptables rules work alongside any VPN.

**VPN coexistence guides:**

| VPN | VPN Mode | Root Mode |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Tailscale** | Not compatible (both need VPN slot). Use root mode or proxy mode. | Works. HostShield iptables rules filter DNS alongside Tailscale's tunnel. Tailscale MagicDNS handles `.ts.net` domains outside HostShield. |
| **Mullvad** | Not compatible. | Works. Mullvad routes all traffic through WireGuard; HostShield filters DNS via iptables before it enters the tunnel. Mullvad's DNS leak protection is additive. |
| **WireGuard** | Not compatible. | Works. Set HostShield's local DNS (`127.0.0.1:5454`) as the WireGuard interface DNS, or let iptables NAT redirect DNS queries before they reach the tunnel. |
| **Proxy mode** | Use HostShield in proxy mode (no VPN slot) alongside any VPN. DNS filtering works via local proxy on the device. | N/A |

**What happens on Android 15/16 if protection is killed or denied at boot?**
Protection services use Android's `systemExempted` foreground-service type for VPN/root/proxy filtering, and each service records timeout events before shutting down cleanly. If Android denies a boot or background restart, HostShield records `foreground_service_start_failed` in the local diagnostic export and the Home screen asks the user to reopen the app and enable protection again.

**Does it send data to any server?**
No. All DNS filtering happens locally on-device. The only network requests are: downloading blocklist sources (user-configured URLs), encrypted DNS queries to the user-selected provider, optional rate-limited GeoIP lookup through ipapi.co, and optional remote DoH bypass / CNAME cloak list updates from GitHub. Remote DoH bypass updates are accepted only when their payload hash and release-key signature verify.

**What about VPN recovery after an Android 16 update?**
On Android 16 and newer, HostShield watches for the narrow recovery pattern in which its VPN
service reports always-on lockdown, the TUN descriptor is still valid, a physical network is
validated, and no inbound tunnel packet arrives during the first two minutes. It records one
redacted `vpn_recovery_snapshot` diagnostic event and shows a Home recovery banner only when
all of those signals agree. **Workaround**: restart the device when the banner appears. The
connected validation matrix can update a debug APK and capture API-36/API-37 evidence with
`-AttemptRecoveryObservation`; an advisory is required only when the test device has
always-on VPN and lockdown configured.

**What about Work Profiles and Private Spaces?**
Android Work Profiles managed by a DPC (Device Policy Controller) can override VPN settings. Known limitations: (1) The DPC may force its own always-on VPN, preventing HostShield's VPN from starting. Use root mode instead. (2) Some DPCs set a lockdown VPN that bypasses user VPN tunnels entirely, causing DNS queries from work apps to leak to Google DNS or the DPC's resolver. (3) Work Profile DNS resolution may route through a separate network stack that HostShield cannot intercept in VPN mode. Android 15's Private Spaces create an isolated user profile. HostShield detects Private Spaces (since v6.5.1) and shows a warning banner when VPN-based DNS filtering may not cover apps inside the private space. **Workaround**: use root mode for full coverage across all profiles, or enable always-on VPN with lockdown in Android settings to force all profiles through HostShield's tunnel.

**What about battery life?**
VPN mode: ~1-3% battery/day (all traffic routed through local TUN interface). Root mode: ~0% additional battery (iptables operates at kernel level). The DNS cache (60-70% hit rate) and serve-stale reduce upstream queries significantly.

## Version History

| Version | Highlights |
|---------|-----------|
| **6.9.69** | New adaptive and round launcher artwork with Android 13 themed-icon support. |
| **6.9.68** | Audit drain: context-firewall background rules, working block redirect targets, a pre-API-34 shortcut-toggle bypass, denyallow/Mullvad filtering scope, and release gates that verify what they claim. |
| **6.9.67** | Roadmap drain: encrypted-only backup secrets with real schema-v2 roundtrips, retained diagnostic/PCAP artifacts with test seams, and malformed threat-feed health accounting. |
| **6.9.66** | Roadmap drain: scoped `$denyallow` semantics, pre-34 automation attribution, fresh stats widgets, validated redirect targets, and debug WireGuard key configuration. |
| **6.9.62** | HostShield-hosted Spotify Ads list with five device-confirmed additions, migration v20 for existing installs, and a live audit/repair of every default and gallery blocklist endpoint. |
| **6.9.61** | Source-health repair: successful large lists are sampled instead of falsely marked dead at 5 MiB, disabled sources no longer inflate health errors, migration v19 clears legacy failure state, worker cancellations no longer look like update failures, the AdGuard CNAME feed URL is repaired, and Spotify Ads is available as an optional disabled-by-default built-in source. |
| **6.9.60** | Roadmap drain: blocking profiles now apply their per-profile source set; auto-update, Wi-Fi-only, protection-notification, and log-retention settings are exposed in the UI; threat-intel carries forward a failed feed's cached IOCs; root DNS attribution maps are bounded and its iptables teardown serialized; `$important` block precedence and IPv6 PCAP export are implemented; the launcher toggle is gated to trusted callers. |
| **6.9.59** | Deep engineering + security + UX audit: the per-app iptables firewall now actually applies (an apply-ordering bug meant it never did), the DNS proxy path fails closed instead of leaking plaintext, IPv6 DNS answers carry a valid UDP checksum, offline blocklist refresh no longer wipes the live snapshot, downloaded allowlists can no longer whitelist malware past threat intel, backup/restore preserves wildcard and regex rules, and dozens of worker, preference, theming, and accessibility fixes. |
| **6.9.58** | Dense Logs, Sources, Apps, and Firewall lists now support persisted saved filters, accessible filtered empty states, and top/middle/end jump controls for large local datasets. |
| **6.9.57** | AdGuard `$dnstype=` block and allow rules now survive source rebuilds as qtype-aware policy, with A/AAAA/negated type enforcement in VPN, proxy, root, and local DNS decisions instead of being silently dropped or globalized. |
| **6.9.56** | Release builds now make experimental DNS controls truthful: DoQ and WireGuard DNS are documented as debug-only, release docs are guarded against release-effective claims, and disclosure tests lock the forced-off production policy. |
| **6.9.55** | Removed premature Local DNS Server feature claims from current release docs until a production Settings, lifecycle, permission, and status path is wired; release-doc checks now reject reintroduced current Local DNS Server claims. |
| **6.9.54** | Periodic, scheduled-profile, and VPN startup blocklist rebuilds now share a forced full-snapshot source coordinator, so 304 cache validations cannot leave the in-memory blocklist empty and changed source counts, ETags, Last-Modified values, sizes, and health metadata persist consistently. |
| **6.9.53** | Coalesced concurrent identical DNS cache misses per route/qtype so only one upstream resolver call runs, while each app still receives a response with its own DNS transaction ID. Cache prefetch and serve-stale refreshes now update cache state without sending duplicate client responses. |
| **6.9.45** | Refined secondary Android UI surfaces with shared headers, segmented controls, responsive empty/loading states, and smoother app-exclusion loading. |
| **6.9.44** | Launcher icon resources now live in the unqualified adaptive-icon directory and include a monochrome layer for Android themed icons. |
| **6.9.43** | Widget secondary labels now use at least 11sp text for better launcher readability and accessibility. |
| **6.9.42** | Firewalled-app count labels now use Android plural resources so single-app and multi-app summaries read correctly. |
| **6.9.41** | Hardened the WebRTC leak-test WebView with stricter settings, safe bridge parsing, blocked navigation, and bridge cleanup after each probe. |
| **6.9.40** | Widget metadata now keeps Android 12+ target-cell sizing in qualified resources while the base widget definitions stay valid for API 26-30. |
| **6.9.39** | Moved the API 27-only light-navigation-bar theme setting into a qualified resource so the base theme stays valid for API 26. |
| **6.9.38** | Older Android releases now skip API 29-only VPN status and Quick Settings subtitle calls instead of relying on unavailable platform methods. |
| **6.9.37** | Updated the lint-reported stable Compose BOM and Tink dependencies while keeping Lifecycle pinned to the current compile SDK line. |
| **6.9.36** | Home stats and source-management labels now use Android string resources instead of hardcoded Compose text, improving localization readiness and reducing unused-resource lint noise. |
| **6.9.35** | Dropped-query warnings now use Android plural resources so one-query and multi-query messages read correctly. |
| **6.9.34** | Room enum converter fallbacks now log bounded warnings when corrupted or future enum values are read from the database. |
| **6.9.33** | Added a Room migration and covering index for per-app DNS domain aggregation to keep app drill-downs responsive on large logs. |
| **6.9.32** | DNS cache and stale-cache responses now run post-forward CNAME/threat checks, app-scoped threat allows behave consistently, and Logs has a threat-review queue filter. |
| **6.9.31** | Settings exports now use a shared destination artifact model with correct filenames, MIME types, privacy copy, Save As for diagnostics, and tested file/content streaming. |
| **6.9.30** | Local DNS server LAN abuse controls now apply a global per-window query cap in addition to the per-client limit. |
| **6.9.29** | Blocklist regex matching now enforces a per-rule execution deadline, and decision-cache entries are tied to the blocklist snapshot that produced them. |
| **6.9.26** | Premium UX polish pass: shared screen headers, square icon actions, selected filters, inline actions, clearer source/log/rule/settings states, and more compact-screen-safe row layouts. |
| **6.9.25** | Backup schema v2 search history, empty-catch logging, unused resource cleanup, DoH3 dead-code annotation. |
| **6.9.24** | HomeViewModel deduplication (shared blocklist build, combined pref observers) and lint baseline burndown (14 fixes). |
| **6.9.23** | Security/correctness audit: LocalDnsServer fail-closed, BlocklistHolder most-specific-wins trie, WebDavSync path-traversal rejection, Pi-hole ReDoS guard, CI SHA pinning, release lint gate, manifest alias cleanup, LogsScreen ViewModel extraction. |
| **6.9.22** | Threat-intel blocked log details now include review actions for a global domain allow or an app-scoped DNS allow rule for the affected app/domain pair. |
| **6.9.21** | Stats now shows local threat-intel impact by feed with 24h/7d block counts, last matched time, top affected domains/apps, and a compact 7-day feed trend. |
| **6.9.20** | Main app navigation now applies explicit system-bar insets so top-level and sub-screen content stays clear of Android 15+ status and navigation bars while edge-to-edge remains enabled. |
| **6.9.19** | Theme color tokens now use a per-composition palette instead of global mutable state, preventing high-contrast/accent variants from racing when multiple themed surfaces coexist. |
| **6.9.18** | DNS log temporary-allow timers now use WorkManager, so process death or Doze cannot leave a temporarily allowed domain unblocked after the selected window expires. |
| **6.9.17** | Parental controls now detect legacy unsalted SHA-256 PIN hashes at app launch, force the user through the PIN upgrade gate, and rewrite the hash to the current KDF after successful verification. |
| **6.9.16** | Deep engineering audit: fixed blocklist data loss on all-304 periodic refresh, missing regex rules in VPN rebuild, per-app DNS rule cache torn-state, DNS cache TTL overcapping, hourly chart UTC mismatch, threat-intel domain swap race, GeoIP cache unbounded growth, VPN restart coroutine leaks, stability metric loss on DB failure, EDE JSON injection. Added legacy backup rules for API 26-30, restricted FileProvider paths, cleaned ProGuard dead rules. |
| **6.9.15** | Additional release-state polish: Blocklist Gallery now has explicit loading, unavailable, empty, success, and add-failure states using shared status surfaces; gallery add failures are logged and shown as errors instead of green success messages; Home warning dismiss/restart actions, automation copy, TLS/crash clear actions, parental message dismiss, and app privacy expand controls have larger touch targets; app privacy and content filter rows truncate long text safely. |
| **6.9.14** | Public-release polish for shared status surfaces, Home protection errors, DNS tools, hosts utilities, firewall controls, and the blocklist gallery: user-facing failures no longer expose raw exception text, repeated firewall controls and gallery add actions use larger touch targets, shared status/empty actions reserve larger hit areas, and gallery cards handle long labels/descriptions safely. |
| **6.9.13** | Stricter release polish for Rules, Sources, and DNS Logs: redirect rules now validate IPv4/IPv6 targets, regex errors no longer expose parser text, source/log failures use user-facing copy with detailed logs preserved, long rule/source/log text truncates safely, DNS log query-type filters wrap on narrow screens, and key icon/selection controls have larger touch targets. |
| **6.9.12** | Second-pass release polish for Settings-adjacent flows: WebDAV now preserves saved passwords when the password field is left blank, QR sharing fits narrow screens and uses accessible status banners, rule testing has keyboard submit behavior and long-domain handling, and diagnostic/PCAP/CSV export states use clearer touch targets and user-facing failure copy. |
| **6.9.11** | DoH now honors the user-selected provider as the primary resolver while using latency only for failover ordering. Gradle versions moved to `libs.versions.toml`, Settings PCAP export exposes all/DNS/firewall modes with visible share failure feedback, and release-doc checks now catch stale FGS, DoH3, GeoIP, and version metadata claims. |
| **6.9.9** | New launcher icon assets across Android icon densities, README screenshots, and AdAway Default plus StevenBlack Unified enabled by default with an upgrade migration for existing installs. |
| **6.9.8** | Removed the non-root "Root not detected" Home banner, fixed Settings > View on GitHub so it opens the repository in a browser, and simplified the Sources header to keep only the add-source action. |
| **6.9.7** | Animated the active protection orb with a rotating arc, trailing sweep, and breathing halo so the dashboard visibly communicates active protection. |
| **6.9.6** | Manual blocks now turn matching live DNS activity rows red, accent color preferences apply to the active app theme, and blocklist rebuilds use less memory. |
| **6.9.5** | First-run notification permission is now deferred until protection activation instead of covering onboarding, and the DNS resolver step uses a compact accessible selector so all resolver choices are visible on tall phones. |
| **6.9.4** | Release signing now fails closed unless real signing credentials are configured or an explicit local debug-signing override is set. Imports, backups, QR config, diagnostics, threat feeds, WebDAV, GeoIP, update checks, and DEX scans now use bounded input and stricter validation. Secondary controls have larger accessible touch targets. |
| **6.9.3** | Threat-intel feed health dashboard added to Stats with per-feed freshness, HTTP status, entry counts, SHA-256 prefixes, failure state, and manual refresh. Diagnostic exports now include redacted threat-feed health summaries. |
| **6.9.2** | Embedded Cronet removed and DoH3 disabled while no maintained non-vulnerable Cronet artifact is available. Pinned OkHttp DoH/DoT remains the production encrypted DNS path, and release posture/provenance scripts now record the no-bundled-Cronet state. |
| **6.9.1** | Debug pseudolocales enabled, RTL/pseudo-expanded Compose layout scaffold added, Home/Settings/QR strings moved through resources, and QR config import/export validation kept covered by JVM tests. |
| **6.9.0** | AdGuard `$dnsrewrite` import support. NXDOMAIN/REFUSED/null-IP rewrites imported as block rules. A/AAAA IP rewrites parsed as redirect rules. 3-part form (`NOERROR;A;1.2.3.4`) supported. Unsupported CNAME rewrites counted in diagnostics. |
| **6.8.0** | Threat-intel feed health tracking. Per-feed HTTP status, SHA-256, entry counts, staleness detection, and consecutive failure tracking with full cache persistence. Compile-warning deprecation cleanup: removed dead NetworkChangeReceiver, migrated clipboard API, updated MaxMind accessors. ZXing/Room 3.0/Accrescent evaluations documented. |
| **6.7.2** | Historical local-first GeoIP path for log detail enrichment. Current builds use the bounded ipapi.co lookup path documented above. |
| **6.7.1** | Temporary bypass timer. Home screen pause now offers 5/15/30/60-minute durations with visible countdown and auto-resume via WorkManager. |
| **6.7.0** | TargetSdk 36 (Android 16). QR config import hardened with bounded decompression, Base64 padding tolerance, and separated import planning. |
| **6.6.9** | License unification and hardening. Unified project license on GPL-3.0, resolving the root MIT / app GPL-3.0 conflict that blocked F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid publication. |
| **6.6.8** | QR config import completion. QR transfer now exports real rules and custom sources, previews import deltas, applies validated rules/sources/DNS settings, rejects oversized compressed payloads, and accepts only HTTPS source URLs before insertion. |
| **6.6.7** | Safe Search correctness hardening. DNS-level enforcement now handles Google country domains, answers A and AAAA queries with safe endpoints or NODATA as appropriate, suppresses HTTPS/SVCB metadata answers, and caches resolved canonical safe-search endpoints with bundled fallbacks. |
| **6.6.6** | Local DNS server abuse hardening. LAN DNS mode now rejects public clients by default, applies per-client query throttling, emits TC=1 for oversized UDP answers, reuses the shared DNS packet builder, and loads configured DoT/DoH/custom upstream preferences before plaintext fallback. |
| **6.6.5** | Wi-Fi-only sync hardening. Periodic threat-intel and source-health refresh workers now use the same Wi-Fi-only network constraint as blocklist updates, and changing the setting refreshes existing WorkManager registrations instead of leaving stale constraints behind. |
| **6.6.4** | Threat-intel parser hardening. Whitespace-separated compromised-IP feeds now parse into CIDRs correctly, invalid/broad tokens are rejected, duplicate feed tokens are de-duplicated, partial feed refreshes report degraded status while preserving successfully parsed data, and the release-doc gate now allows scoped per-version store changelogs while keeping durable metadata checks strict. |
| **6.6.3** | Release gate consolidation. GitHub releases now run release-doc checks, Cronet posture validation, full unit tests, full APK build, Play AAB build, provenance/checksum generation, and artifact upload before publishing. |
| **6.6.2** | Automation API contract repair. Public docs now use canonical `com.hostshield.ACTION_*` actions and `duration_minutes`, the manifest exposes every supported automation action, lowercase aliases remain compatible, and unit tests lock the action/extra normalization contract. |
| **6.6.1** | Dependency hardening. Updated OkHttp to 5.4.0 for the current stable networking stack, including the 256 KiB HTTP/2 response-header cap and current Okio baseline. |
| **6.6.0** | Android 15/16 foreground-service resilience. Protection services now declare `systemExempted`, runtime foreground promotion uses the matching service type, service timeout callbacks record local diagnostics, and all protection restart surfaces record controlled start-failure events instead of crashing. |
| **6.5.9** | DNSCrypt stamp and relay-route foundation. `sdns://` parsing now uses spec-width properties, preserves 32-byte DNSCrypt provider keys, parses Anonymized DNSCrypt relay stamps, and validates resolver-to-relay routes before building relay target prefixes. |
| **6.5.8** | DoH3 resolver transport. Existing DoH now tries embedded-Cronet HTTP/3/QUIC first, accepts only actual `h3`/QUIC negotiation, labels successful query-log upstreams as `DoH3`, and falls back to the existing pinned OkHttp DoH path when HTTP/3 is unavailable. |
| **6.5.7** | VPN route canonicalization. `VpnService.Builder.addRoute` paths now mask IPv4/IPv6 host bits before route insertion, preserving host routes while preventing Android 11+ validation failures for user-provided network prefixes. |
| **6.5.6** | Magisk 26+ mount-master hardening. Root firewall command paths now detect Magisk 26+ and prefer libsu's mount-master shell for `iptables`, `ip6tables`, and route-localnet sysctl work, with focused version-gate coverage. |
| **6.5.5** | TCP DNS fallback verification. Added shared RFC 7766 truncation handling, wired IPv6 UDP forwarding through the same `TC=1` TCP retry path as IPv4, and covered path-MTU-sized truncated responses with a 200 ms retry-start regression. |
| **6.5.4** | Hot-reload blocklist hardening. Production rebuild paths now use `BlocklistHolder.updateAsync()` so trie construction happens off the caller thread before the single snapshot swap, with concurrent-reader regression coverage. |
| **6.5.3** | Doze/App Standby resilience pass. Moved protection foreground services to explicit foreground-service type declarations, documented every WorkManager job, kept blocklist refresh expedited for immediate runs, and added a 60-second VPN heartbeat with structured kill/fd-failure events. |
| **6.5.2** | Android 16 always-on VPN recovery advisory. Detects the always-on + lockdown + validated-network + zero-tunnel-ingress pattern, surfaces a Home recovery banner, and offers a rooted device restart action for the post-update VPN-stack corruption case. |
| **6.5.1** | Premium UX/UI polish pass. Refined Compose shape and typography consistency, improved first-run onboarding layout and copy, fixed page-indicator/CTA collisions, converted the feature overview to a compact grid, anchored DNS resolver actions, moved Sources/Rules actions into header controls, improved loading/empty/error/selection/accessibility states, fixed debug automation permission side-by-side install, and corrected WebDAV failed-listing handling. |
| **6.5.0** | Engineering hardening pass. Parental PIN fail-closed + brute-force lockout, PBKDF2 iterations raised to 600k, backup decrypt off-by-one fixed, RootUtil hostname injection guard, device-transfer no longer leaks encrypted prefs, widget receiver no longer launchable by other apps. ACTION_PAUSE > 10s now works via WorkManager (was killed by `goAsync()` timeout). TCP DNS fallback on TC=1 (RFC 7766). BlocklistHolder atomic snapshot + real LRU decision cache. DoH/DoT response size caps + cert-pin diagnostics. DnsCache RFC 2308 MINIMUM=0 honored, RR cap raised. Onboarding DNS choice now persisted. Sources URL validation + category picker. Settings update-check throttled. CHANGELOG / README version drift repaired. |
| **6.4.0** | Security hardening audit, architecture refactor, reliability improvements. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). |
| **6.3.0** | Preferences facade over 6 domain managers, BlocklistHolder unified trie walk, DB v14 composite indices, PBKDF2 PIN hashing, encrypted backups, DoH fail-closed, HTTPS-only sync URLs, SHA-256 integrity, RootUtil shell injection fixes. |
| **6.2.0** | DoQ resolver (RFC 9250), WireGuard DNS proxy, 7 new UI screens, ConnectionTracker + TlsFingerprinter wired in. **Release hardening audit**: fixed ~60 operator precedence bugs in DNS wire format parsing across 6 files, WireGuard encryption failure no longer leaks plaintext, OkHttp response leaks fixed in 8 files, shell command injection prevention in root mode, CoroutineScope lifecycle fix in LocalDnsServer, private IP range validation fix, Compose crash safety, ProGuard rules for all new classes. **52/52 roadmap items complete** |
| **6.1.0** | Per-app DNS rules, content filtering (15 categories), proxy mode, QR config sharing, parental controls, crash reporter, WebDAV sync, connection tracker, Vico charts, Lottie animations, Glance widgets |
