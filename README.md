# HOSTShield: Curated Hosts Files

HOSTShield is a collection of highly aggressive, categorized `hosts` files designed to be minimal, yet block a large spectrum of domain communication, focusing on telemetry, diagnostics, updates, and non-essential services.

These lists are specifically formatted for consumption by external hosts file management utilities, such as the companion project **HostsFileGet**.
