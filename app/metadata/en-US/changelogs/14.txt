v1.4.0 - Performance & Security Audit

DNS Bypass Prevention:
- Block 15+ DoH/DoT/DoQ endpoints at DNS level (Firefox canary, Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, NextDNS, AdGuard, OpenDNS)
- Root mode: block DoT (port 853), DoH (port 443 TCP), DoQ (port 443 UDP) via iptables
- VPN mode: silent drop of non-DNS traffic to trapped DoH provider IPs
- Firefox DoH canary (use-application-dns.net) returns NXDOMAIN to disable browser DoH

Performance:
- 10-50x faster DNS log writes via batched inserts (flush every 2s or 500 entries)
- Stats accumulator eliminates per-query DB reads
- Composite index on (blocked, timestamp) for instant filtered log queries
- ANR-safe iterative batch log cleanup (1000 rows/batch with 50ms yield)
- Eliminated redundant in-memory domain Set (saves ~50% blocklist memory)
- Volatile trie root for thread-safe concurrent reads

Custom DNS:
- VPN mode now properly uses custom upstream DNS from settings
- Supports multiple servers (comma/semicolon separated) with automatic fallback

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed SOA serial using dynamic date instead of hardcoded value
- Fixed network change handler preserving blocklist (no re-download)
- Fixed log buffer flushing on VPN stop (no lost final entries)
- Fixed QUIC (UDP 443) bypass in root mode
- Database migration v4->v5 for new indexes
