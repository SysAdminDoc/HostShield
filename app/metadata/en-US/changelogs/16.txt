v1.6.0 - Stability & Update Checker

Critical Fixes:
- Fixed VPN infinite cycling caused by network callback firing on VPN's own interface (5s cooldown + onLost tracking)
- Fixed Root mode showing no live DNS activity (switched to proxy-only blocking architecture)
- Fixed App Activity screen showing empty data (consequence of VPN cycling + hosts-file bypass)
- Fixed network callback accumulation on VPN restarts (proper unregister before re-register)
- Fixed background workers reverting proxy-only blocking by writing full hosts file

Architecture Change:
- Root mode now uses DNS proxy as sole blocker instead of /etc/hosts file
- All DNS queries flow through the proxy for logging and per-app attribution
- Hosts file contains only localhost entries; blocking handled by iptables NAT redirect to proxy

New Features:
- GitHub release update checker in Settings (checks api.github.com for new APK releases)
- Dynamic version display from BuildConfig (no more stale hardcoded version strings)
- View on GitHub link in Settings

Code Quality:
- Removed unused imports across workers
- Version bumped to v1.6.0 across all 54 source files
